                INTRODUCTION
            </h2>
            <p class="text-s mt-10 pt-5 leading-8 font-thin">
                Yala National Park is one of the largest and most popular parks in Sri Lanka. It owes its fame to the
                fact that
                it has one of the most numerous leopard populations
                per square kilometer in the world. The reserve borders the Indian Ocean on its southern and eastern
                sides, and
                is home to over 250 species of birds and mammals.
                The park is less than a four-hour drive from the national capital, Colombo. The reserve can only be
                traveled by
                off-road vehicle (in the form of a so-called safari), and for a surcharge,
                you can hire a guide to tell you about this wonderful place in English.

                Yala National Park was established on March 1, 1938, and is probably the most popular and visited
                national park in Sri Lanka. The park is divided into five blocks covering some 979 square kilometers.
                These stretch from the inland jungle to the beaches on the Indian Ocean. The 37-kilometer coastline that
                forms the park's southern border is the nesting place for five species of turtles. The constantly
                changing dunes can reach heights of up to 25 meters. Yala consists mainly of metamorphic rocks with
                reddish-brown and gray soil that covers most of the area. The vast terrain consists of shrublands,
                riverine forests, moist, dry monsoon forests, thorn forests, and sweet and brackish wetlands. The park
                is located in a dry and semi-dry region with rainfall occurring mainly during the monsoon season falling
                in October-December. This is when the local vegetation begins to “revive” and take on color. The Yala
                Reserve is one of the best places in the world to observe leopards. Between 40 and 70 individuals live
                here (data depending on the source).
                <br><br>
                Sri Lanka is one of the few countries in the world the population every day has a contact with wild
                animals. Often can to see elephants crossing the road or sneaking into a hotel lobby. There are more
                than 20 national parks on the island, but what sets Yale Park feature from others is the wide variety of
                animals. The variety of birds, mammals, and reptiles is unparalleled on the island.
                <br><br>
                During the safari, we travel in a specially adapted jeep. The rear of the vehicle, where we sit, is
                raised and only partially enclosed, which provides a better view. In addition, those sitting in the
                front can undraw the windshield, which provides the opportunity to take nicer photos. During the trip,
                you must not leave the car. Many animals are in the distance and are difficult to see with the naked
                eye, so it's a good idea to carry binoculars. Jeeps are allowed to enter Yala National Park twice a day;
                at 6 in the morning and at 2 in the afternoon. According to rangers, there is no ideal time frame for
                observing animals, but it is worth bearing in mind that in the morning it is the birds that are more
                active while in the evening it is the mammals. At noon, due to high temperatures, animals hide deep into
                the jungle from the sun. The Yala tour lasts about 4 hours or a full day, depending on which option one
                chooses. A guide in the park is not required, but drivers usually speak little or no English. The guide
                is very useful for spotting animals, selecting the best route and explaining how the circle of life in
                the reserve works. This will give you a better understanding of the behavior of the local animals and
                allow you to ask questions about the park.
                <br><br>
                The park has three ticket offices and four entrance gates. The busiest and southernmost gate is
                Palatupana, which stands on the southwestern border of Block I, about 20 kilometers from Tissamaharama.
                Less popular, but also well-known, Katagamuwa Gate stands 12 km east of Kataragama on the northwestern
                edge of Block I. No public transportation operates to either gate. If you don’t have private
                transportation, you'll have to buy a trip to the park from one of the local hotels or tour operators
                based in Tissamaharama. Tickets can be purchased at both gates. The Galge ticket office, which opened in
                2016, is located on the east side of Buttala Road, on the border of Blocks III and IV, 18 km north of
                Kataragama. It serves two separate gates on opposite sides of the main road. The eastern gate offers
                direct access to Block III and Block IV. Whereas the western, offers access to Block V, as well as
                indirect access (through Block V) to the more easterly Lunugamwehera National Park. Any bus that runs
                between Kataragama and Buttala can drop you off at the Galge ticket office, and you can usually pick up
                a jeep on-site, although just as well (and inexpensively) it can do in Kataragama

            <p class="container mx-auto text-sm leading-5 mt-8">
                Yala National Park is located in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, about 290 kilometers from the
                capital,
                Colombo. The reserve is located along the southeast coast and borders the waters of the Indian Ocean.
                Some
                of Sri Lanka's best surfing, swimming, and diving conditions occur here. Less than 13 kilometers
                offshore
                are the two coral reefs of Great Basses and Little Basses, as well as the two lighthouses of Maha
                Ravana,
                and Kuda Ravana.

            </h2>

            <p class="container mx-auto text-sm leading-5 mt-8">
                Maha Ravana Lighthouse got its name from the caves found in the local area on the seabed. The reef area
                was above the surface of the water and was “attached” to the rest of the island, and the caves served as
                a hideout for the ancient king, Ravana. After the sea level rose, these areas were flooded. Now there
                are lighthouses on top of both Great Basses and Little Basses reefs. There are three shipwrecks around
                the lighthouse on Great Basses. Both reefs abound with a large variety of fish and coral. Both sites can
                be reached from the town of Kirinda, from near the Jetwing Yala Hotel.
                <br><br>
                And what is the history of shipwrecks? The entire southeastern coast of Sri Lanka was once located on
                the shipping route to China and India. Navigation in the local waters was difficult and ships often
                stranded on the local reefs. The three wrecks located near the Maha Ravana lighthouse are of Indian,
                British and Portuguese origin. Diving there, you can find many interesting things – from British shells
                or beer bottles, to pieces of old ship decorations, and coins. It is worth mentioning that in the Indian
                ship that belonged to Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, there were probably only silver rupees that the ruler
                wanted to pay for the marble from which the Taj Mahal was built in the early 17th century. Arthur C
                Clarke (British novelist and science fiction writer) searched for this vessel and found it in 1961,
                extracting a significant portion of the valuables.

            <p class="container mx-auto text-sm leading-5 mt-8">
                Blocks are differently “areas.” Some of them have their names. Block 1, also known as “Ruhuna National
                Park,” is the most visited. It has 146 square kilometers and there most tourists go. Due to its
                popularity, many of the animals in Block 1 are more accustomed to cars, making them less frightened and
                not run away. In that is easier to spot, including elephants and leopards here. A full-day drive around
                Block 1 also gives you time to explore the relatively untouched area around the Menik River. Almost all
                safaris take place in Block 1, which is characterized by a high density of wildlife and an abundant
                scattering of natural watering holes and artificial reservoirs that were built by the ancient Ruhuna
                kings. In the area of Block 1, it is possible to obtain previous permission to cross the Menik River by
                bridge to the little-visited Block 2, which has a 35-kilometer coastline and is dotted with streams,
                lagoons and restored water reservoirs. Blocks 3 and 5 are quieter and there is less traffic, which gives
                the impression of a more “private safari”. However, the animals are more wary of humans. Block 5’s area
                is only 26 square kilometers, but it’s where you’ll find some of the most multiple clusters of waterfowl
                on the island. Block 5 borders the even less-visited Lunugamwehera National Park, a 245-kilometer area
                of dense forests centered around the eponymous tank where nearly 185 species of birds live. To the east,
                Yale Park borders Kumana National Park, which was once known as “Yala East” and can be accessed from the
                town of Arugum Bay. Kumana has many wetland tracts, which attract many migrating birds between April and
                July. Blocks 3 and 4 are covered with dense vegetation, which can make that we won’t see animals.
