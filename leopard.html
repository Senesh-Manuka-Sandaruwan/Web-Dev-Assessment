                            The Yala National Park is your go-to destination for leopard sightings. Touted by the
                            Ministry of
                            Tourism and Lands as the
                            perfect location for spotting leopards in the wild, this park is divided into five blocks.
                            However,
                            most jeep safaris offer a tour of Block 1,
                            which is where your chances of seeing leopards and other animals are highest.
                            Travellers in pursuit of where to see leopards in Sri Lanka often ask us, “How many leopards
                            in Yala
                            National Park?” There are
                            an estimated 60 to 70 leopards scattered around the park, making it a tourist destination
                            with the
                            highest density of leopards
                            in the world. But because the park covers an area of 979 square kilometres, there is no
                            guarantee
                            that a leopard sighting will
                            be a part of your experience. On the bright side,
                            it means that you have a strong chance of eventually spotting them.

                            in Yala

                            There are an estimated 60 to 70 leopards scattered around the park, making it a tourist
                            destination
                            with the highest density
                            of leopards in the world. But because the park covers an area of 979 square kilometres,
                            there is no

                            If catching a glimpse of these predators is on your bucket list, the recommended time for a
                            jeep
                            safari ranges from between 6.00am to 9.00am and 3.00pm
                            to 6.00pm.
                            While I would personally recommend the morning safaris, waking up as early as
                            6.00am may
                            prove to be a challenge—especially for families travelling with children. So,
                            it is no surprise that most families choose an afternoon safari instead.
                            When scheduling your trip to Yala, you should keep in mind that, with the exception of Block
                            5, the
                            other blocks of
                            the national park are typically closed to the public from the 1st of September to the 15th
                            of
                            October.
                            This annual closure is because of the dry season, and the absence of tourists during this
                            time
                            allows the animals
                            to freely wander around the park in search of water.
                            Block 5 is left open because the animals in the vicinity are able to quench their thirst at
                            its
                            large reservoir.

                        When scheduling your trip to Yala, you should keep in mind that, with the exception of Block
                        5, the
                        other blocks of
                        Travelling to Yala comes with its ups and downs. The peak seasons (December to March, and
                        the months
                        of July and August)
                        are hectic, and the park is crowded with jeeps carrying other tourists. So,
                        if the prospect of travelling among crowds is not your cup of tea, I would recommend
                        vacationing in
                        Sri Lanka during its off-peak season.
                        During peak season you could always go for a jeep safari at the Wilpattu National Park
                        instead.
                        While overcrowding is one of the most common complaints among tourists, many seem to be under
                        the
                        impression that
                        they are guaranteed a leopard sighting at Yala. Even if your jeep races around the park in
                        search of
                        leopards,
                        there is no guarantee that you will see them at all.
                        My first leopard “sighting” is proof of that. Catching a leopard in action depends entirely on
                        your
                        luck
                        That is why I would recommend that you focus on the other animals too. If Lady Luck is not on
                        your
                        side and
                        there are no leopards nearby,
                        you will still be able to see wild boars, crocodiles, elephants, water buffaloes, spotted deer,
                        sambar deer,
                        jackals, Toque macaques, sloth bears, peacocks, junglefowls, and other animals up close.
                        If your primary motive for visiting the Yala National Park is spotting leopards, it is best that
                        you
                        take a full day safari.
                        If crowds are no issue, and if you would like to increase your chances of spotting leopards in
                        the
                        wild,
                        a jeep safari at the Yala National Park is your best bet!

                            Home to all kinds of flora and fauna, the Wilpattu National Park covers an area of 1,317
                            square
                            kilometres,
                            making it the largest national park in the country. However, unlike Yala, which welcomes
                            crowds of
                            tourists
                            with its famed leopard sightings,
                            this national park is less frequented—but that does not mean that your chances of spotting
                            leopards
                            are zero.
                            Not many travellers choose a jeep safari at Wilpattu due to logistic issues. In fact, its
                            neighbouring region of
                            Anuradhapura is not on the typical tourist itinerary, and the park itself is located further
                            away
                            from the usual tourist route.
                            But that is what makes it so perfect for
                            introverts and for those who would like to enjoy the beauty of nature away from the crowds.
                            While the density of leopards in Wilpattu is not as high as that of Yala, spotting these
                            elusive
                            predators is not completely out
                            of the question. If you are lucky, you will be rewarded with a glimpse of them. If not, you
                            will
                            still stumble upon a
                            variety of other animals,
                            including elephants, sloth bears, spotted deer, sambar deer, mongooses, water buffaloes,
                            peacocks,
                            and many more.
                            And that is not all! This national park gets its name from the 'villus', or the naturally
                            formed
                            rainwater lakes which complete the
                            scenic beauty of its landscape.
                            It is a feature unique to Wilpattu, and you are guaranteed to get a couple of shots of
                            animals
                            lingering by the waterside.
                            That being said, since we have talked about the perks of visiting Wilpattu, let us move on
                            to its
                            cons.
                            Unlike Yala, this national park is made up of dense forests and vegetation. This makes it
                            somewhat
                            difficult to spot animals.
                            I have noticed that travellers who come to Wilpattu have high expectations that they will
                            see
                            animals in crowds shortly after
                            entering the park, but that is not the case. While it is true that the park is packed with
                            wildlife,
                            you may have to venture into its depths for several hours before you are able to experience
                            what it
                            has to offer.
                            And that is why I would recommend half day safaris, which are scheduled between 6.00am to
                            11.00am
                            and 2.00pm to 6.00pm.

                        If a jeep safari at the Wilpattu National Park is on your itinerary, keep in mind that
                        accommodation is
                        typically arranged in Anuradhapura. As its location is further away from the typical tourist
                        route, the lodging
                        choices in Wilpattu are narrow. Your jeep safari here will be arranged as a day tour. So, if the
                        prospect of
                        travelling to and from Anuradhapura
                        for two hours is not your cup of tea, a tour of the Yala National Park might be better suited
                        for you.
                        All things considered, the chances of spotting leopards in Wilpattu are not as high as that of
                        the Yala National Park.
                        But if travelling away from the hustle and bustle of Yala to enjoy the wildlife in seclusion is
                        your preference,
                        I would recommend the slow-paced jeep safari at the Wilpattu National Park.
                        However, leopard sightings are not restricted to Yala and Wilpattu. We have had many guests who
                        have spotted leopards in Horton Plains,
                        Minneriya, and Udawalawe. But the reason why we do not recommend these locations to those who
                        wish to see leopards up close is
                        because leopard sightings in these locations are extremely uncommon. After all,
                        these elusive predators can be quite difficult to spot among the rich wildlife and vegetation.
                        If a jeep safari at any of these parks is on your itinerary, you should be prepared for a bumpy
                        ride.
                        This is especially the case if news spreads fast of a leopard in the vicinity at the Yala
                        National Park.
                        The other jeeps may race around and crowd together, creating an uproar that may scare off the
                        leopard.
                        You may also experience the congestion of the roads and a lot of noise as some jeeps forget to
                        switch off
                        their engines while observing the wildlife up close.
                        This, in turn, may stress out the animals.
                        It goes against our ethics at Travellers Isle, because we believe that jeep safaris can be
                        conducted in a way
                        that leaves the animals undisturbed in their natural habitats while satisfying
                        our travellers with plenty of close-ups.

                    With its rolling hills, misty landscapes and unique biodiversity, the Horton Plains
                    National Park holds a special place in the hearts of nature enthusiasts and
                    conservationists.

                    Its iconic World’s End cliff, cloud forests and picturesque waterfalls are just a
                    few of the awe-inspiring features that make this small 32-sq.km park a must-visit
                    destination. Like many other natural habitats around the world, Horton Plains too
                    faces challenges such as habitat degradation, invasive species and impacts of
                    climate change.

                    Finding a leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) at the Horton Plains National Park was
                    extremely difficult before 2021. The ‘process of habituation’ (being accustomed or
                    used to something) took place after 2021 when a female leopard got habituated and
                    birthed three cubs here and the cubs got habituated through their mother

                    As of late, when compared to past years, leopards are seen more often in Horton
                    Plains. The increasing frequency of leopard sightings may seem like a positive
                    development, but it may also be indicative of a problem. As leopards get habituated
                    to humans and vehicles, a dangerous situation could arise for both animals and
                    humans. Habituated leopards may become more aggressive and territorial, posing a
                    threat to tourists who venture too close.

                    With Sri Lanka Leopard Day being celebrated on August 1 (Tuesday), it is crucial to
                    address this issue to minimize a human leopard conflict to safeguard this iconic
                    creature.

                Conservation efforts in Horton Plains focus on preserving the delicate montane
                ecosystem, recognizing its importance for the well-being of leopards and other wildlife.
                Research and monitoring activities are likely conducted to assess the leopard
                population, study their behavior, and understand the impact of human activities on their
                habitat. These efforts aim to strike a balance between conservation and sustainable use
                of the natural resources in the park.
                One of the challenges faced by leopards in Horton Plains is the potential for
                human-wildlife conflict. As human activities and settlements encroach upon wildlife
                habitats, instances of conflict may arise. Additionally, managing tourism to minimize
                disturbance to wildlife is crucial. Striking a balance between allowing visitors to
                appreciate the natural beauty of the park and protecting the resident wildlife is
                essential for the long-term conservation of the ecosystem.

                For the most up-to-date and specific information regarding the leopard population in
                Horton Plains National Park, including ongoing research and conservation initiatives, it
                is advisable to consult local wildlife authorities, conservation organizations, and
                recent scientific publications related to Sri Lankan leopards.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-sm leading-7 mt-2">

                    The Sri Lankan leopard, Panthera pardus kotiya, confronts a significant threat from
                    habitat loss, primarily induced by escalating
                    human activities. Extensive deforestation for timber, agricultural expansion, and
                    rapid urbanization have collectively led to the
                    reduction and fragmentation of the leopard's natural habitats. This jeopardizes the
                    species by limiting their territorial space,
                    disrupting ecological balance, and increasing conflicts with humans as they encroach
                    into settlements in search of food.
                    The consequences are dire, resulting in a diminished prey base, restricted breeding
                    opportunities, and an overall decline
                    in the Sri Lankan leopard population. Conservation efforts, including the
                    establishment of protected areas, habitat restoration projects,
                    and community engagement initiatives,
                    are crucial to mitigate the impact of habitat loss and ensure the long-term survival
                    of this unique and endangered species.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-sm leading-7 mt-2">
                    The Sri Lankan Leopard, scientifically known as Panthera pardus kotiya, graces the
                    island's landscapes with its captivating presence.
                    Illegal wildlife trade poses a grave threat to the Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera
                    pardus kotiya), as its coveted body parts and skins are sought
                    after in black markets. The consequences are severe, leading to a decline in the
                    leopard population and disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem. This
                    illicit activity not only
                    fuels the loss of biodiversity but also has socio-economic repercussions. Efforts to
                    combat illegal wildlife trade involve stringent anti-poaching measures,
                    collaboration with law enforcement agencies, and public awareness campaigns to
                    educate communities about the importance of preserving Sri Lanka's rich wildlife.
                    Conservation institutions, such as [insert relevant organization],
                    play a vital role in implementing these strategies and safeguarding the Sri Lankan
                    leopard from the perils of the illegal wildlife trade.
